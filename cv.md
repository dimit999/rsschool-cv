### Briefly About Myself:
  > I have more than 10 years of experience in the IT-sphere.<br>
  > In a previous project, I worked as a QA Manager. I have managed a big team (6 Manual QA’s and 8 Auto QA’s). My daily duties included the distribution
  > of tasks between the testers, quality control tasks, updating the stand, gathering metrics, creating a test strategy/test plan (QA plan), coordinating
  > a planned approach to testing, communication with PM, BA, devs. Participating in grooming sessions, planning, daily, retrospective meetings, I did
  > review test processes on other projects. On my pre-last projects, I worked using Scrum + estimation test cases for automation, creation of QA
  > Automation plan, communication with a customer about code review, automation plans.
  > In my current project, I work on the customer's side in Abu Dhabi/Dubai (Emirates) for more than 3 years - government project - [TAMM](https://www.tamm.abudhabi/). I work as a QA Team Lead.

### Skills:
  Technical stack:
  * Development languages: Python (full automation knowledge for any WEB/API/MOBILE projects), JS (Basic development knowledge: can fix UI bugs).

  For Python:
  * Tools/libraries for working with interfaces (API, database, GUI, etc.) - pytest, allure, hamcrest, axe, locust;
  * Tools for organizing and running tests (PyTest, RobotFramework, etc.) - pytest;
  * Structure and tools for a centralized runner (for example, Jenkins CI) - pipeline, Jenkins CI;
  * Report generation tools - allure, html;
  * Run of autotests on pipeline(GIT), mobile devices (Android, iOS: via Appium).

  For JavaScript:
  * JS;
  * HTML;
  * CSS/SASS;
  * REACT (a little experience);
  * TS (a little experience).

  No issues about Java, have some experience, quickly can start to work with it.

  My responsibilities on a current project with Python language as a QA Automation  Lead:
  * Communication between governments/customers and journeys about releases;
  * Quality control of more than 10 projects/journeys -> ~ 30+ people;
  * Quality control: Front-end/Back-end (automation scripts) (Desktop/Mobile view), Back-end(API), responsiveness, Native apps;
  * Interview with newcomers;
  * Creating new solutions on Python: framework/testing solutions/pipeline configuration/QA dashboard (ReportPortal) configuration for viewing test results.
  For Example:
  1. Python framework: for WEB automation: Chrome/FF/Safari/Edge, WEB for mobile devices (Android/IOS for emulators and real devices), Native app (Android/IOS).
  2. Python solutions: Cookies checker/Broken Links checker/JS errors checker/Accessibility testing/Localization testing.
  3. Python extended allure report.
  4. Pipeline configuration for running tests remotely.
  5. Selenoid configuration (solution for running tests remotely)
  6. ReportPortal configuration (solution for showing test results) + info from JIRA + dev info(SonarQube/ZAP/Eslint/etc) with my personal additional features. Example: [Automation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15oCjCHdvzxboNM6KGG1qL3Ur30ma3Jc3/view?usp=sharing), [Jira](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tixR7-P3_9ziB9-08uZPTxBPwlLz95yI/view?usp=sharing).
  7. And a lot of other python solutions.
