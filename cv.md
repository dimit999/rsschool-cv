### Briefly About Myself:
  > I have more than 12 years of experience in the IT-sphere.<br>
  > **In my current project**, In my current project, I work as a Head of QA || Automation Architect on the customer's side in Dubai (Emirates) - FinTech, e-commerce platform. My daily duties include big team management, the distribution of tasks between the testers, quality control tasks, gathering metrics, creating a test strategy/test plan (QA plan), coordinating a planned approach to testing, and communication with PM, devs. Participating in grooming sessions, planning, and daily, retrospective meetings, the same I review other aspects of work and suggest cases of how to improve it. For Automation: framework creation/supporting/tests creation if necessary.
  
  > I can create automation from zero for any project with useful solutions and show you automation benefits. For example, except for normal checking functionality, I can create automation solutions for checking translations/test WEB benchmarks (CSS/JS/Image sizes/font qty)/test API performance/Accessibility/etc + automate daily routine work like creating reports/get team metrics/etc.
I have experience for working with ReportPortal where possible to show full information about test-runs/common jira statistics/get and show info from SonarQube etc.
