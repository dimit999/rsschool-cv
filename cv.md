### Briefly About Myself:
  > I have more than 11 years of experience in the IT-sphere.<br>
  > **In my current project**, I work as a QA Lead || Automation Architect on the customer's side in Dubai (Emirates). My daily duties include big team management, the distribution of tasks between the testers, quality control tasks, gathering metrics, creating a test strategy/test plan (QA plan), coordinating a planned approach to testing, and communication with PM, devs. Participating in grooming sessions, planning, and daily, retrospective meetings, the same I review other aspects of work and suggest cases of how to improve it.
  
  > I can create Automation from zero in any project with very useful solutions and show to you automation benefits. For example, except for normal checking functionality, I can create automation solutions for checking translations/test WEB benchmarks (CSS/JS/Image sizes/font qty)/test API performance/Accessibility/etc + automate daily routine work like creating reports/get team metrics/etc.
I have experience for working with ReportPortal where possible to show full information about test-runs/common jira statistics/get and show info from SonarQube and etc.

### Skills:
  Technical stack:
  * Development languages: Python (full automation knowledge for any WEB/API/MOBILE projects), JS (Basic development knowledge: can fix UI bugs).

  For Python:
  * Tools/libraries for working with interfaces (API, database, GUI, etc.) - pytest, allure, hamcrest, axe, locust;
  * Tools for organizing and running tests (PyTest, RobotFramework, etc.) - pytest;
  * Structure and tools for a centralized runner (for example, Jenkins CI) - pipeline, Jenkins CI;

   * Creating new solutions on Python: framework/testing solutions/pipeline configuration/QA dashboard (ReportPortal) configuration for viewing test results.<br>
  * Communication between governments/customers and journeys about releases;
  * Quality control of more than 10 projects/journeys -> ~ 30+ people;
  * Quality control: Front-end/Back-end (automation scripts) (Desktop/Mobile view), Back-end(API), responsiveness, Native apps;
  * Interview with newcomers.<br>
  
Example of my created solutions :
 1. Python framework: for WEB automation: Chrome/FF/Safari/Edge, WEB for mobile devices (Android/IOS for emulators and real devices), Native app (Android/IOS).
 2. Python solutions: Cookies checker/Broken Links checker/JS errors checker/Accessibility testing/Localization testing.
 3. Python extended allure report.
 4. Pipeline configuration for running tests remotely.
 5. Selenoid configuration (solution for running tests remotely)
 6. ReportPortal configuration (solution for showing test results) + info from JIRA + dev info(SonarQube/ZAP/Eslint/etc) with my personal additional features. Example: [Automation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15oCjCHdvzxboNM6KGG1qL3Ur30ma3Jc3/view?usp=sharing), [Jira](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tixR7-P3_9ziB9-08uZPTxBPwlLz95yI/view?usp=sharing).
